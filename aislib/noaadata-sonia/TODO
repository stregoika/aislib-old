to a file and forwarding to TCP.

Eventually want to put everything under a noaadata namespace, right?

Get almost all code (other than opt parse) out of the scripts directory
and into better engineered/reusable modules.

Refactor to get all ais related stuff under the ais namespace:  comments?
Maybe stuff under utils should be just in ais?

  ais
   |- compiler1
   |- compiler2 (rewrite the current compiler)
   |- c_compiler
   |- util
   |- db (break the database stuff down somewhat)
   |- msgs ... itu m 1..64  (all binary messages are in a subdirectory by defining athority)
       |- ris
       |- sls
       |- pawss (probably just alias to sls)
       |- rtcm (prototype messages_
       |- uscg? or do I do this by the dac?  dac366
